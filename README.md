# Running Hours Tracker

I have made this project to be a Python application estimating hours to be run in a week depending on hours run today. The rationale behind this project revolves around learning how to take inputs from users in Python applications and basic calculations to be performed. The project also encompasses basic use of Git control.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.

3. Execute one of these commands:

githubproject.py
